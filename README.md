# Mi Proyecto

This is a Django-based project designed to manage various aspects of project management. It's structured to provide a comprehensive environment for managing projects, including models, views, and administrative interfaces.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `mi_proyecto`: The core Django project directory containing settings, URLs, and WSGI configurations necessary for project deployment and operation.
- `GESTOR_PROYECTOS`: A Django app created within the project to handle specific project management tasks such as database models, views, and admin configurations.

### Key Components

- `mi_proyecto/settings.py`: Contains settings for the Django project, including database configurations, installed apps, middleware, and more.
- `mi_proyecto/urls.py`: Defines the URL routes for the project.
- `mi_proyecto/wsgi.py`: WSGI configuration for deployment.
- `GESTOR_PROYECTOS/models.py`: Defines the database models for the project management app.
- `GESTOR_PROYECTOS/views.py`: Contains views for handling web requests.
- `GESTOR_PROYECTOS/admin.py`: Configures the Django admin interface for the project management app.
- `manage.py`: A command-line utility that lets you interact with this Django project.
